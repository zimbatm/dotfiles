Minimalist NixOS configuration repo for my machines.

1. Use [blueprint](https://github.com/numtide/blueprint) to automatically map
   the folder structure to flake outputs. Keep the boilerplate Nix code to the
   minimum.
2. Use [SrvOS](https://github.com/nix-community/srvos) for opinionated
   NixOS defaults.
3. Use [disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko) for declarative disk
   partitioning.
4. Powered by [Garnix](https://garnix.io) for free CI and binary cache.
